# CSV FILE READING IN C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
Hello World
CSV stands for Comma Separated Values. The process of reading CSV can be broken down into two steps:

> Read a line -> L
> Split L by ,

Now, you have the values of the row.

## Reading a line
> we use fgets() from string.h.

## Tokenizing
Tokenizing is the processing of splitting a string by any given character, in our case we want to split it by ,.

> we use strtok() from string.h
